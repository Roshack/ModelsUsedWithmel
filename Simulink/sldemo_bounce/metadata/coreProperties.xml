This model calculates the trajectory, over time, of a ball thrown 
upward with a velocity of 15 meters per second from a height of 10 m. 
The model demonstrates the use of the 'ReinitDXDTwhenXreachesSaturation' 
parameter in the Second-Order Integrator block to model this system. 
This parameter, when set to 'on', forces a reinitialization of dx/dt 
(velocity in the model) at the instant when x (position) reaches 
saturation (i.e., when the ball hits the ground). The reinitialized value 
is calculated by multiplying a coefficient of restitution times the ball 
velocity, the instant before the ball hits the ground. The Memory block 
in the calculation loop serves to capture the velocity of the ball just 
before it hits the ground. The position of the ball is plotted in the 
upper axis of the scope while the velocity of the ball is plotted in 
the lower axis.</dc:description><cp:lastModifiedBy>Bert</cp:lastModifiedBy><dcterms:modified xsi:type="dcterms:W3CDTF">2021-04-07T00:37:22Z</dcterms:modified><cp:revision>5.1</cp:revision><cp:version>R2021a</cp:version></cp:coreProperties>
